<p>We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order to maintain the

safety of your personal information.</p>

<p>All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and credit card details for

financial transactions are not stored or processed on our servers.</p>

<h2>Do we use “cookies“?</h2>

<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s

hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service

provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.</p>

<p>For instance, we use cookies to help us understand your preferences based on previous or

current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services.</p>

<p>We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction

so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>

<p>We use cookies to understand and save user’s preferences for future visits. Globalmotors may

place a text file called a “cookie“ in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself

does not contain personal information, but it will enable Globalmotors to relate your use of

Globalmotors’s Website to personal information that you have specifically, voluntarily, and

knowingly provided to Globalmotors. But the only personal information a cookie can contain

is information that you supply yourself.</p>

<p>A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read other cookie files created by other

websites. Globalmotors may use cookies to track your traffic patterns (as described above).

In addition, Globalmotors uses encrypted cookies to authenticate your identify on each page

after you log on to the Website. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser.

If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the

warning message with each cookie. Some of Globalmotors’s Services may not function properly

if your cookies are disabled.</p>

<p>The use of cookies by third-parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy. Globalmotors does

not have access or control over these third-party cookies. These third-parties use session

ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate Globalmotors’s Website.</p>

<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can

choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer)

settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn

the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>

<h2>Third Party Disclosure</h2>

<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable

information.</p>

<h2>Third party links</h2>

<p>The Web site may contain contents from web sites controlled by parties other than CFW. Copart

and IAAI web site content is one of them. CFW is not responsible for and does not endorse or

accept any responsibility for the contents or use of these third party web sites.</p>

<p>CFW is providing this content to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link

does not imply endorsement by CFW of the linked web site. It is your responsibility to take

precautions to ensure that whatever you select for your use is free of viruses or other

items of a destructive nature.</p>

<h2>Google</h2>

<p>Google’s advertising requirements can be summed up by Google’s Advertising Principles. They

are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.

<p>Globalmotors uses Google AdSense to publish ads on the Website. When you view or click on an

you on Globalmotors’s Website and other websites. You may opt-out of the use of this cookie

by visiting

<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google’s

Advertising and Privacy page</a>.</p>

<h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online

services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to

require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates

websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a

conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected

and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See

<a href="http://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/#sthash.0FdRbT51.tG17CSDg.dpbs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CalOPPA

website</a></p>

<p><strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong></p>

<p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>

<p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a

minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy“, and can be easily be found on the page

specified above.</p>

<p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</p>

<ul>

<li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>

</ul>

<p>Users are able to change their personal information:</p>

<ul>

<li>By emailing us</li>

<li>By logging in to their account</li>

</ul>

<h2>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h2>

<p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do

Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>

<h2>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h2>

<p>It’s also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking.</p>

<h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>

<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the

Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade

Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells

out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and

safety online.</p>

<p>We do not specifically market to children under 13 and do not allow visitors below 13 years

old to register on our website as a consumer.</p>

<h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>

<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United

States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of

data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice

Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy

laws that protect personal information.</p>

<p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following

responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></p>

<p>We will notify the users via in site notification within 7 business days after the

 identification of the data breach.</p>

<p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a

right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail

to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable

rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government

agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

<h2>CAN-SPAM Act</h2>

<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements

for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent

to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

<p>We collect your email address in order to use it for login on our website and send you weekly

newsletter.</p>

<p><strong>To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM we agree to the following:</strong></p>

<p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us

at and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</p>
